# _

Originally named `/nul`, `/_` is a repository of nothing.

Well, this repository is made for testing many things. It's open, random, and unprofessional.

The current license in [LICENSE](https://github.com/ant1597/nul/blob/main/LICENSE) file does not imply anything because it is one of the test subject - this repository is under a BSD 3-Clause License.

## Q&A

<s>`Q`: Can I clone this repository?  
`A`: Feel free to do so! But I don't think you can clone it in Windows operating system or DOS.</s>

`Q`: Why is there a striked-through QA pair?
`A`: The repository was originally named `nul`, thus it might not be possible to extract it in DOS-based system since it is a [reserved device name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS#Reserved_device_names)
