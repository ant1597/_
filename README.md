A repository of nothing.

Well, this repository is made for testing many things. It's open, random, and unprofessional.

The current license in [LICENSE](https://github.com/ant1597/nul/blob/main/LICENSE) file does not imply anything because it is one of the test subject - this repository is under a BSD 3-Clause License.

## Q&A

`Q`: Can I clone this repository?  
`A`: Feel free to do so! But I don't think you can clone it in Windows operating system or DOS.
